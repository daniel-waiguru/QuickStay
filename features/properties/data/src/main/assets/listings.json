This neighborhood’s vibrant roots are depicted through its large-scale murals, discussed in its museums, and revered by its members. The draw of its deep seeded traditions is matched by superb subway accessibility. Although East Harlem is gaining notoriety as a neighborhood to watch, it’s still raw at its core—especially after sunset.",

I would envision myself roller skating to school, going to see the Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center or swimming at the beach on Coney Island.  By the time I was four, I was determined to move to New York City when I grew up.  \r\nWhich I did.  And I raised my own four children here on a diverse block with the whole city as their school and playground.\r\nThey are all grown up now and their rooms lie empty.  The treehouse from which one could see Central Park is still in our backyard; their video games are still in the play loft we built for them; many of their surviving toys are in the room where my grandchildren play when they come to visit. \r\nBut for days on end no children are here.\r\nMeanwhile there are children all over the world who grow up with images of New York on their TV screens, in their books and in their movies.  They, too, want to experience the city for themselves.  And their parents want to bring them; but there are no other affordable accommodations specifically designed for families.  The only children who ever get to see New York are the offspring of the 1%.  \r\nAt this B&B, families can strengthen their bonds and create lifelong memories together as they visit all the iconic New York sites: The Statue of Liberty, Times Square, The Museum of Natural History.  But their children are also getting a taste of what it's like to be a New York City kid: playing stoop ball off our front steps, running through the sprinkler on our play street, eating ices off the corner hand truck.\r\nIn short, AIRBNB is New York City's ambassador to future generations.  Who knows?  They may grow up and bring their kids here to see this city, too, someday.",

It's a few blocks from Meatpacking District, Union Square, Chelsea Market,  Chelsea Piers, the High Line, Hudson River Park ( where you can ride your Citi Bike and Citi Bikes are everywhere and one station right across the street! )  Tons of restaurants, delis, cafes, banks and supermarkets (one conveniently located right downstairs), and very, very close access to ALL subways.  SERIOUSLY, A GREAT AREA! Also,  the Whitney Museum just opened in the Meat Packing District  (a bout a 7-10 minute walk and  Chelsea Market is 5 minute walking distance.",
            "notes": "- Note:  (The bedroom and living room are separated by a regular wall,  however in lieu of a door there is a thick, very private doubled curtain that keeps out light and most noise)   - Note: I sleep on the couch in the living room and you would  have to walk by me at night to use the restroom. I have nightlight throughout the space so you can see.  I sleep through everything and not an issue, but if this is an issue for you then it's probably not the right space for you.   - Note:  A big, healthy lovable cat on the premises, so must be a cat lover!",

Also,  Citi Bikes are all over the place and one station is right across the street. There is a beautiful riding path along the Hudson river that is about four blocks away.",
